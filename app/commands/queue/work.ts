Usage:
  bun cli ${this.name} [options]

Options:
  --help                   Show this help message

Description:
  Starts background queue workers to process jobs asynchronously.
  This command should be run separately from the web server to prevent
  performance interference.

  The queue workers process:
  - Killmail fetching from eve-kill.com/ESI
  - Killmail value calculations (fetches prices and calculates ISK values)
  - Character/Corporation/Alliance data fetching
  - Price data updates

  Workers poll the database for pending jobs and process them with
  automatic retry logic on failures.

  Each worker has its own concurrency settings defined in the worker class:
  - KillmailFetcher: 5 concurrent jobs
  - KillmailValueUpdater: 10 concurrent jobs (fast - uses LRU cache)
  - ESIFetcher: 10 concurrent jobs
  - TypeFetcher: 5 concurrent jobs

Examples:
  bun cli ${this.name}                    # Start with default settings

Notes:
  - Run this in a separate terminal or process from the web server
  - Use a process manager (pm2, systemd) for production deployments
  - Monitor queue stats via: bun cli queue:stats (if implemented)
`);
  }
}
